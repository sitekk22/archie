.TH ioctl_userfaultfd 2 2022-12-15 "Linux man-pages 6.03"
.SH NAME
ioctl_userfaultfd \- create a file descriptor for handling page faults in user
space
.SH LIBRARY
Standard C library
.RI ( libc ", " \-lc )
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "#include <linux/userfaultfd.h>" "  /* Definition of " UFFD* " constants */"
.B #include <sys/ioctl.h>
.PP
.BI "int ioctl(int " fd ", int " cmd ", ...);"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Various
.BR ioctl (2)
operations can be performed on a userfaultfd object (created by a call to
.BR userfaultfd (2))
using calls of the form:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
ioctl(fd, cmd, argp);
.EE
.in
In the above,
.I fd
is a file descriptor referring to a userfaultfd object,
.I cmd
is one of the commands listed below, and
.I argp
is a pointer to a data structure that is specific to
.IR cmd .
.PP
The various
.BR ioctl (2)
operations are described below.
The
.BR UFFDIO_API ,
.BR UFFDIO_REGISTER ,
and
.B UFFDIO_UNREGISTER
operations are used to
.I configure
userfaultfd behavior.
These operations allow the caller to choose what features will be enabled and
what kinds of events will be delivered to the application.
The remaining operations are
.I range
operations.
These operations enable the calling application to resolve page-fault
events.
.\"
.SS UFFDIO_API
(Since Linux 4.3.)
Enable operation of the userfaultfd and perform API handshake.
.PP
The
.I argp
argument is a pointer to a
.I uffdio_api
structure, defined as:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
struct uffdio_api {
    __u64 api;        /* Requested API version (input) */
    __u64 features;   /* Requested features (input/output) */
    __u64 ioctls;     /* Available ioctl() operations (output) */
};
.EE
.in
.PP
The
.I api
field denotes the API version requested by the application.
.PP
The kernel verifies that it can support the requested API version,
and sets the
.I features
and
.I ioctls
fields to bit masks representing all the available features and the generic
.BR ioctl (2)
operations available.
.PP
Before Linux 4.11, the
.I features
field must be initialized to zero before the call to
.BR UFFDIO_API ,
and zero (i.e., no feature bits) is placed in the
.I features
field by the kernel upon return from
.BR ioctl (2).
.PP
Starting from Linux 4.11, the
.I features
field can be used to ask whether particular features are supported
and explicitly enable userfaultfd features that are disabled by default.
The kernel always reports all the available features in the
.I features
field.
.PP
To enable userfaultfd features the application should set
a bit corresponding to each feature it wants to enable in the
.I features
field.
If the kernel supports all the requested features it will enable them.
Otherwise it will zero out the returned
.I uffdio_api
structure and return
.BR EINVAL .
.\" FIXME add more details about feature negotiation and enablement
.PP
The following feature bits may be set:
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_FORK " (since Linux 4.11)"
When this feature is enabled,
the userfaultfd objects associated with a parent process are duplicated
into the child process during
.BR fork (2)
and a
.B UFFD_EVENT_FORK
event is delivered to the userfaultfd monitor
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMAP " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature is enabled,
when the faulting process invokes
.BR mremap (2),
the userfaultfd monitor will receive an event of type
.BR UFFD_EVENT_REMAP .
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_REMOVE " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature is enabled,
when the faulting process calls
.BR madvise (2)
with the
.B MADV_DONTNEED
or
.B MADV_REMOVE
advice value to free a virtual memory area
the userfaultfd monitor will receive an event of type
.BR UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE .
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_EVENT_UNMAP " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature is enabled,
when the faulting process unmaps virtual memory either explicitly with
.BR munmap (2),
or implicitly during either
.BR mmap (2)
or
.BR mremap (2),
the userfaultfd monitor will receive an event of type
.BR UFFD_EVENT_UNMAP .
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_MISSING_HUGETLBFS " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel supports registering userfaultfd ranges on hugetlbfs
virtual memory areas
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_MISSING_SHMEM " (since Linux 4.11)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel supports registering userfaultfd ranges on shared memory areas.
This includes all kernel shared memory APIs:
System V shared memory,
.BR tmpfs (5),
shared mappings of
.IR /dev/zero ,
.BR mmap (2)
with the
.B MAP_SHARED
flag set,
.BR memfd_create (2),
and so on.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS " (since Linux 4.14)"
.\" commit 2d6d6f5a09a96cc1fec7ed992b825e05f64cb50e
If this feature bit is set, no page-fault events
.RB ( UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT )
will be delivered.
Instead, a
.B SIGBUS
signal will be sent to the faulting process.
Applications using this
feature will not require the use of a userfaultfd monitor for processing
memory accesses to the regions registered with userfaultfd.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_THREAD_ID " (since Linux 4.14)"
If this feature bit is set,
.I uffd_msg.pagefault.feat.ptid
will be set to the faulted thread ID for each page-fault message.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_MINOR_HUGETLBFS " (since Linux 5.13)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel supports registering userfaultfd ranges
in minor mode on hugetlbfs-backed memory areas.
.TP
.BR UFFD_FEATURE_MINOR_SHMEM " (since Linux 5.14)"
If this feature bit is set,
the kernel supports registering userfaultfd ranges
in minor mode on shmem-backed memory areas.
.PP
The returned
.I ioctls
field can contain the following bits:
.\" FIXME This user-space API seems not fully polished. Why are there
.\" not constants defined for each of the bit-mask values listed below?
.TP
.B 1 << _UFFDIO_API
The
.B UFFDIO_API
operation is supported.
.TP
.B 1 << _UFFDIO_REGISTER
The
.B UFFDIO_REGISTER
operation is supported.
.TP
.B 1 << _UFFDIO_UNREGISTER
The
.B UFFDIO_UNREGISTER
operation is supported.
.PP
This
.BR ioctl (2)
operation returns 0 on success.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
Possible errors include:
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I argp
refers to an address that is outside the calling process's
accessible address space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
The userfaultfd has already been enabled by a previous
.B UFFDIO_API
operation.
.TP
.B EINVAL
The API version requested in the
.I api
field is not supported by this kernel, or the
.I features
field passed to the kernel includes feature bits that are not supported
by the current kernel version.
.\" FIXME In the above error case, the returned 'uffdio_api' structure is
.\" zeroed out. Why is this done? This should be explained in the manual page.
.\"
.\" Mike Rapoport:
.\"     In my understanding the uffdio_api
.\"     structure is zeroed to allow the caller
.\"     to distinguish the reasons for -EINVAL.
.\"
.SS UFFDIO_REGISTER
(Since Linux 4.3.)
Register a memory address range with the userfaultfd object.
The pages in the range must be "compatible".
Please refer to the list of register modes below
for the compatible memory backends for each mode.
.PP
The
.I argp
argument is a pointer to a
.I uffdio_register
structure, defined as:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
struct uffdio_range {
    __u64 start;    /* Start of range */
    __u64 len;      /* Length of range (bytes) */

.EE
.in
.PP
The
.I range
field defines a memory range starting at
.I start
and continuing for
.I len
bytes that should be handled by the userfaultfd.
.PP
The
.I mode
field defines the mode of operation desired for this memory region.
The following values may be bitwise ORed to set the userfaultfd mode for
the specified range:
.TP
.B UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING
Track page faults on missing pages.
Since Linux 4.3,
only private anonymous ranges are compatible.

Since Linux 5.7,
only private anonymous ranges are compatible.
.TP
.B UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MINOR
Track minor page faults.
Since Linux 5.13,
only hugetlbfs ranges are compatible.
Since Linux 5.14,
compatibility with shmem ranges was added.
.PP
If the operation is successful, the kernel modifies the
.I ioctls
bit-mask field to indicate which
.BR ioctl (2)
operations are available for the specified range.
This returned bit mask can contain the following bits:
.TP
.B 1 << _UFFDIO_COPY

Do not wake up the thread that waits for page-fault resolution
.TP
.B UFFDIO_COPY_MODE_WP
Copy the page with read-only permission.
This allows the user to trap the next write to the page,
which will block and generate another write-protect userfault message.
This is used only when both
.B UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING
and
.B UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP
modes are enabled for the registered range.

operations are Linux-specific.
.SH BUGS
In order to detect available userfault features and
enable some subset of those features
the userfaultfd file descriptor must be closed after the first
.B UFFDIO_API
operation that queries features availability and reopened before
the second
.B UFFDIO_API
operation that actually enables the desired features.
