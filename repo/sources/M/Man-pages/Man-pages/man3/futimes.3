.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR futimes ()
changes the access and modification times of a file in the same way as
.BR utimes (2),
with the difference that the file whose timestamps are to be changed
is specified via a file descriptor,
.IR fd ,
rather than via a pathname.
.PP
.BR lutimes ()
changes the access and modification times of a file in the same way as
.BR utimes (2),
with the difference that if
.I filename
refers to a symbolic link, then the link is not dereferenced:
instead, the timestamps of the symbolic link are changed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
Errors are as for
.BR utimes (2),
with the following additions for
.BR futimes ():
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.B ENOSYS
The
.I /proc
filesystem could not be accessed.

The following additional error may occur for
.BR lutimes ():
.TP
.B ENOSYS
The kernel does not support this call; Linux 2.6.22 or later is required.
.SH VERSIONS
.BR futimes ()
is available since glibc 2.3.
.BR lutimes ()
is available since glibc 2.6, and is implemented using the
.BR utimensat (2)
system call, which is supported since Linux 2.6.22.
