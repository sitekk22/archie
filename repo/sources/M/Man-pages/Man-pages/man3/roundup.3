.SH DESCRIPTION

This API is not designed to be generic,
and doesn't work in some cases
that are not important for the typical use cases described above.
See CAVEATS.

This macro returns the rounded value.
.SH STANDARDS

.SH CAVEATS
The arguments may be evaluated more than once.

If
.I x + step
would overflow or wrap around,
the behavior is undefined.
