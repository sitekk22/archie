.SH NAME
iswpunct \- test for punctuation or symbolic wide character
.SH LIBRARY
Standard C library
.RI ( libc ", " \-lc )
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.PP
.BI "int iswpunct(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR iswpunct ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR ispunct (3)
function.
It tests whether
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "punct".
.PP
The wide-character class "punct" is a subclass of the wide-character class
"graph", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character class "print".
.PP
The wide-character class "punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class
"alnum" and therefore also disjoint from its subclasses "alpha", "upper",
"lower", "digit", "xdigit".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print",
the wide-character class
"punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph",
the wide-character class
"punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class "space" and its subclass
"blank".
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR iswpunct ()
function returns nonzero
if
.I wc
is a wide-character
belonging to the wide-character class "punct".
Otherwise, it returns zero.

.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR iswpunct ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
.PP
This function's name is a misnomer when dealing with Unicode characters,
because the wide-character class "punct" contains both punctuation characters
and symbol (math, currency, etc.) characters.
