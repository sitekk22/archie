Name
       Linux man-pages - manual pages for GNU/Linux

Synopsis
       This package contains GNU/Linux manual pages for sections 1 through 8.

Description
       The manual pages in this project document primarily the Linux kernel
       and the GNU C library, but also consider relevant differences in other
       kernels or C libraries.

       These pages are most of the section 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 man pages for
       GNU/Linux.  A few pages are provided in sections 1 and 8 for commands
       that are not documented in other packages, and there are a few pages in
       sections 5 and 8 for the timezone utilities.
