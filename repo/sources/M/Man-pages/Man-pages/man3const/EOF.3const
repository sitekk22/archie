(it can't be represented by

POSIX.1-2001 and later.
.SH CAVEATS
Programs can't pass this value to an output function
to "write" the end of a file.
That would likely result in undefined behavior.
Instead,
closing the writing stream or file descriptor
that refers to such file
is the way to signal the end of that file.
