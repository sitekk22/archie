This file is a plain ASCII file, describing the various DARPA internet

even worse, just guessing them.
These numbers will occur in the
protocol field of any IP header.
.PP
Keep this file untouched since changes would result in incorrect IP
packages.
Protocol numbers and names are specified by the IANA
(Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
.\" .. by the DDN Network Information Center.
